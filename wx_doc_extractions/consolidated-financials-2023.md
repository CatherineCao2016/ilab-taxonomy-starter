In 2023, the group transferred its U.K. asset management business to Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI), GS Group’s primary U.K. asset management entity, consistent with GS Group’s resolution planning and the commercial objectives of its asset management business. This business had average annual net revenues of $436 million in 2020 to 2022, approximately 300 employees and immaterial assets and liabilities as of the date of transfer. 

As consideration for the transfer, the group received a non- controlling interest in GSAMI’s immediate parent undertaking, which was measured at fair value through profit or loss, resulting in a gain of $1.42 billion being recognised in net revenues in 2023. The total consideration received was distributed by the group in the fourth quarter of 2023. As such, there was no change in the group’s shareholder’s equity as of December 2023, compared with December 2022, as a result of this transaction. 

# Future Outlook 

The directors consider that the year end financial position of the group was satisfactory.

## On behalf of the board

June 24, 2024 

# Report on the audit of the non-statutory financial statements 

## Opinion 

In our opinion, Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited’s non-statutory group financial statements (the “financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of preparation and accounting policies in note 1 to the financial statements. 

We have audited the financial statements, included within the consolidated financial information, which comprise: consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023; consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information. 

## Basis for opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”), including ISA (UK) 800 and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

### Independence 

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 

## Emphasis of matter - Basis of preparation 

In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not modified, we draw attention to note 1 to the financial statements which describes the basis of preparation, and in particular, the fact that the accounting policies used and disclosures made are not intended to, and do not, comply with the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with a special purpose framework for the directors for the specific purpose as described in the Use of this report paragraph below. As a result, the financial statements may not be suitable for another purpose. 

In addition, we draw attention to the fact that these financial statements have not been prepared under section 394 of the Companies Act 2006 and are not the company’s statutory financial statements. 

## Conclusions relating to going concern 

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. 

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. 

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. 

## Reporting on other information 

The other information comprises all of the information in the consolidated financial information other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance thereon. 

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. 

## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements 

As explained more fully in the statement of directors responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the basis of preparation and accounting policies in note 1 to the financial statements and for determining that the basis of preparation and accounting policies are acceptable in the circumstances. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. 

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") and Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA"), and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as corporate tax legislation. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting of inappropriate journal entries and management bias through the manipulation of the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included: 

* • Discussions with management, including Internal Audit, and those charged with governance in relation to known or suspected
* • Evaluating and testing of the operating effectiveness of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect fraud in financial
* • Assessing matters reported on the company’s whistleblowing helpline and the results of management’s investigation of such matters;
* • Reviewing key correspondence with regulatory authorities(the FCA and the PRA);
* • Identifying and testing selected journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted by senior management, account owners,
* • Challenging assumptions and judgments made by management in their critical accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the
* • Incorporating unpredictability into the nature, timing and/or extent of our testing. instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud; reporting; individuals in particular departments (including front office) and unusual account combinations with a credit to revenue; valuation of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value; and

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non- compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. 

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report. 

### Use of this report 

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s directors as a body for management purposes and in support of the consolidated Pillar III disclosures of the UK regulated group in accordance with our engagement letter dated 10 May 2024 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come, including without limitation under any contractual obligations of the company, save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information 

Note 1. 

## Summary of Material Accounting Policies 

### Basis of Preparation 

The non-statutory consolidated financial information of the group (consolidated financial information) has been prepared by the directors to support the consolidated Pillar III disclosures of the group. 

The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention (modified as explained in “Financial Assets and Liabilities” and “Pension Arrangements” below) and in line with the recognition and measurement requirements of U.K.-adopted international accounting standards. These recognition and measurement requirements have been chosen to align with those followed by the company’s principal subsidiaries. The accounting policies applied in respect of measurement and recognition are set out below. 

### Consolidation 

The consolidated financial information includes the company and all of its subsidiaries. In accounting for subsidiaries the group fully consolidates their assets, liabilities and results for the year. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated from the consolidated financial information. The accounting reference date of the company and its subsidiaries is December 31. 

### Accounting Policies 

Revenue Recognition. Net revenues include the net profit arising from transactions, with both third parties and affiliates, in derivatives, securities and other financial instruments, and fees and commissions. This is inclusive of associated interest and dividends. 

#### Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised at fair value with realised and unrealised gains and losses, as well as associated interest and dividend income and expenses included in net revenues, with the exception of changes in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss attributable to own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment or DVA), which is recognised in other comprehensive income, unless this would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The group measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). 

Unrealised gains and losses related to the change in fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised from trade date in net revenues or other comprehensive income in the case of DVA. 

Contractual interest is included in interest income and expense for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, for which contractual interest is included in gains and losses from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss. 

#### Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

Revenues earned from contracts with customers for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with customers) are recognised when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed. 

Where the group recognises revenues in its capacity as principal to a transaction and incurs expenses to satisfy some or all of its performance obligations under these transactions, it is required by IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (IFRS 15) to report these revenues gross of the associated expenses. Such revenue is included in net revenues and such expenses are included in transaction based and other expenses. 

The group is principal to the transaction if it has the primary obligation to provide the service to the customer. The group satisfies the performance obligation by itself, or by engaging other GS Group affiliates to satisfy some or all of its performance obligations on its behalf. 

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information 

Net revenues are recognised as follows: 

* • Financial Advisory and Underwriting Fees from financial advisory and underwriting engagements are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the services related to the underlying transactions are completed under the terms of the engagement.
* • Execution and Client Clearing Transactions Revenue from commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as OTC transactions is recognised in net revenues on the day the trade is executed.
* • Investment Management Services Management fees are recognised on an accrual basis and are generally calculated as a percentage of a fund or a separately managed account’s average net asset value. All management fees are recognised over the period that the related service is provided. Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund’s return or a percentage of a fund’s excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees earned from a fund or a separately managed account are recognised when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account.

Short-Term Employee Benefits. Short-term employee benefits, such as wages and salaries, are measured on an undiscounted basis and accrued as an expense over the period in which the employee renders the service to the group. Provision is made for discretionary year-end compensation whether to be paid in cash or share-based awards where, as a result of group policy and past practice, a constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date. 

Share-Based Payments. Group Inc. issues awards in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) to the group’s employees in exchange for employee services. Group Inc. generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards and the group has no obligation to settle the awards. The awards are therefore classified as equity settled. As a result the cost of share-based transactions with employees is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The group recognises the grant-date fair value of the award in compensation and benefits in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding credit directly to equity. For share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, which include awards granted to retirement eligible employees), the grant-date fair value is expensed immediately. For share-based awards that require future service, the grant- date fair value is recognised over the relevant service period. Expected forfeitures are included in determining the amount of awards expected to vest and thus the share-based employee compensation expense. 

Cash dividend equivalents, unless prohibited by regulation, are generally paid on outstanding RSUs. The group has also entered into a chargeback agreement with Group Inc. under which it is committed to pay to Group Inc., at the delivery date of the shares, an amount in cash equal to (a) the grant-date fair value of those awards and (b) subsequent movements in the fair value of those awards between the grant date and ultimate delivery to employees (subsequent to the vesting date). The group accounts for (a) by recognising a payable to Group Inc. in other liabilities based on the grant-date fair value of the award, with a corresponding debit directly to equity and for (b) by recognising the subsequent movement in the fair value of awards between the grant date and ultimate delivery to employees in compensation and benefits in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding increase or decrease in other liabilities. As a result, the share-based payment transaction and chargeback agreement, in aggregate, gives rise to a total charge to the consolidated income statement based on the grant-date fair value of the awards adjusted for subsequent movements in the fair value of those awards up to delivery. 

Current and Deferred Taxation. Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the group operates and generates taxable income. 

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated, but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future with the following exceptions: 

* • Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
* • Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Current tax and deferred tax is generally recognised in the consolidated income statement or directly in other comprehensive income according to where the associated gain or loss was recognised. The income tax on interest on Additional Tier 1 notes (AT1 notes) is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

Dividends and Distributions. Final cash dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholder. Interim cash dividends are recognised and deducted from equity when paid. Non-cash distributions are recognised and deducted from equity when approved by the company’s shareholder. 

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information 

Cash and Cash Equivalents. This includes cash at bank and highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. 

Foreign Currencies. The group’s consolidated financial information is presented in U.S. dollars, which is also the functional currency of the company and its principal subsidiaries. 

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange ruling on the date the transaction occurred. Monetary assets and liabilities, and non- monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit before taxation. 

The results of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets and results are reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 

Financial Assets and Liabilities. 

### Recognition and Derecognition 

Financial assets and liabilities, other than cash instruments purchased or sold in regular way transactions, are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or if the group transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. A transferred financial asset qualifies for derecognition if the group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; or if the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset but does not retain control. Financial liabilities are derecognised only when they are extinguished, i.e., when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires. 

### Classification and Measurement: Financial Assets 

The group classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of both the group’s business model for managing financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The business model reflects how the group manages particular groups of assets in order to generate future cash flows. Where the group’s business model is to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, the group subsequently assesses whether the financial assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Financial assets with embedded derivatives (hybrid instruments) are also subject to the same assessment. 

* • Financial assets measured at amortised cost. Financial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows and have cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. The group considers whether the cash flows represent basic lending arrangements, and where contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the financial asset is mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss (see below). Financial assets measured at amortised cost are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and allocating the interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying value of the financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial asset but does not consider future credit losses. Finance revenue is recorded in net revenues. Financial assets measured at amortised cost include: 
	+ • Cash and cash equivalents;
	+ • Certain collateralised agreements, which consists of certain resale agreements and the majority of securities borrowed;
	+ • Certain other assets, which consists of certain intercompany loans and substantially all miscellaneous receivables and other.

Cash instruments purchased or sold in regular way transactions are recognised and derecognised using settlement date accounting. 

* • Customer and other receivables;
* • Certain loans and investments; and
## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information 

* • Financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets that are not held for the collection of contractual cash flows and/or do not have cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value are initially measured at fair value with transaction costs expensed in the consolidated income statement. Such financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in net revenues. Financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value include: 
	+ • Certain collateralised agreements, which consists of substantially all resale agreements and certain securities borrowed;
	+ • Trading assets, which consists of trading cash instruments and derivatives;
	+ • Certain loans and investments; and
	+ • Certain other assets, which consists of certain intercompany loans.
* • Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows and sale and have cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value with transaction costs expensed in the consolidated income statement. Such financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated income statement. Finance income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include certain government and agency obligations within investments.

### Classification and Measurement: Financial Liabilities 

The group classifies its financial liabilities into the below categories based on the purpose for which they were acquired or originated. 

* • Financial liabilities held for trading. Financial liabilities held for trading are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at fair value through profit or loss, with gains or losses recognised in net revenues. Financial liabilities held for trading include trading liabilities, which consists of: 
	+ • Trading cash instruments; and
	+ • Derivatives.
	+ • Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. The group designates certain financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at fair value through profit or loss, with DVA being recognised in other comprehensive income, if it does not create or enlarge an accounting mismatch, and the remaining changes in the fair value being recognised in net revenues. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income attributable to own credit spreads are not subsequently transferred to the consolidated income statement, even upon derecognition of the financial liability. The primary reasons for designating such financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are: 
		- • To eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases; and
		- • The group of financial liabilities, or financial assets and liabilities, is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis.Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss include: 
	
	
		- • The majority of repurchase agreements;
		- • Certain securities loaned;
		- • Secured debt securities issued, bank loans and other borrowings, which consists of hybrid financial instruments, transfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than sales, certain prepaid commodity contracts;
		- • Certain deposits; which consists of certain time deposits; and
		- • Certain unsecured borrowings, which consists of certain debt securities issued, substantially all other borrowings, certain intercompany loans and certain prepaid commodity contracts.Hybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain embedded derivatives that are able to be bifurcated. The group can either bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt or designate the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss. If the group bifurcates the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortised cost.
## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information 

* • Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. See “Financial assets measured at amortised cost” above for further information on the effective interest method. Finance costs, including discounts allowed on issue, are recorded in net interest income and interest expense. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include: 
	+ • Certain repurchase agreements and substantially all securities loaned;
	+ • Customer and other payables;
	+ • Certain deposits, which consists of all overnight deposits and certain time deposits;
	+ • Certain unsecured borrowings that have not been designated at fair value through profit or loss; and
	+ • Other liabilities, which primarily consists of compensation and benefits and accrued expenses and other.

### Impairment 

The group assesses the expected credit losses associated with financial assets measured at amortised cost on a forward-looking basis in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (IFRS 9). The measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money, and reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Expected credit losses are recorded in net revenues. 

The group’s impairment model is based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost and incorporates the following three stages: 

* • Stage 1. Financial assets measured at amortised cost that are not credit-impaired on initial recognition and where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The ECL is measured at an amount equal to the expected credit losses that result from default events possible within the next twelve months.
* • Stage 2. Financial assets measured at amortised cost where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, however not yet deemed to be credit-impaired. The ECL is measured based on expected credit losses on a lifetime basis.
* • Stage 3. Financial assets measured at amortised cost that are in default, or are defined as credit-impaired. The ECL is measured based on expected credit losses on a lifetime basis.

The ECL is determined by projecting the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default for each individual exposure. To calculate expected credit losses these three components are multiplied together and discounted back to the reporting date. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original effective interest rate. The probability of default represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation. The loss given default is the group’s expectation of the extent of loss on the default exposure, and takes into consideration amongst other things, collateral on the financial asset. The exposure at default is the amount the group expects to be owed at the time the financial obligation defaults. The group uses internal credit risk ratings that reflect the assessment of the probability of default of individual counterparties. The group uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios within the ECL calculation, the weightings for which are subject to ongoing internal review and approval. 

The ECL model takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions. The forecasts include baseline, favourable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. To the extent the group has financial assets in Stage 2 or Stage 3 which have an expected life beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modelled approach. The group applies judgement in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. 

Forward-looking information, such as key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit losses, is incorporated into both the assessment of staging and the calculation of ECL. 

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information 

The group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. When a financial asset is deemed to be uncollectable, the group concludes this to be an indicator that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The group still seeks to recover amounts it is legally owed in full, but which have been 

The group applies a statistical method that utilises regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of its fair value hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to wholly or partially written off due to no reasonable expectation of full recovery. 

### Classification of Financial Liabilities and Equity 

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements. A financial liability is any liability that is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all liabilities. Instruments are evaluated to determine if they contain both liability and equity components. The initial carrying value of a compound financial instrument is allocated first to the liability component, measured at fair value, and the equity is assigned the residual amount. 

### Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities 

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated balance sheet where there is: 

* • Currently a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognised amounts; and
* • Intent to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%. Possible sources of ineffectiveness on these hedges include: 
	+ • Differences in timing of cash flows between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
	+ • Differences in discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as cash collateralised derivatives are discounted using Overnight Indexed Swap discount curves, which are not consistently applied to the hedged item.
	+ • Counterparty credit risk impacting fair value movements on uncollateralised interest rate swaps but not the underlying hedged item.

For qualifying fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives and the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are included in net revenues. When a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge, any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. 

Collateralised Agreements and Collateralised Financings. Collateralised agreements include resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralised financings 

Where these conditions are not met, financial assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet. include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, secured debt securities issued, intercompany loans and other borrowings. See “Classification and Measurement: Financial Assets” and 

### Fair Value Hedges 

The group applies hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ (IAS 39) for certain interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long and short-term borrowings. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative hedge must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the group must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the derivative hedge continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship. “Classification and Measurement: Financial Liabilities” above for details on the classification and measurement of these instruments. Collateral received or posted can be in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is recognised/derecognised when received/paid. Collateral posted by the group in the form of securities is not derecognised from the consolidated balance sheet, whilst collateral received in the form of securities is not recognised in the consolidated balance sheet. If collateral received is subsequently sold, the obligation to return the collateral and the cash received are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet. 

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information 

Pension Arrangements. The group is a sponsor of a defined contribution pension plan, and a hybrid pension plan for the benefit of certain employees. The hybrid pension plan has both a defined benefit section (the Plan) and a defined contribution section. These are accounted for as follows: 

* • For the defined contribution pension plan and the defined contribution section of the hybrid pension plan, the contributions payable for the period are charged to net operating expenses. Differences between contributions payable for the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the consolidated balance sheet.
* • For the Plan, the amounts charged to net operating expenses are any past service costs, administration costs and any gains or losses on settlements and curtailments. These amounts are included in compensation and benefits. The net interest is included in net interest income/(expense). Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Plan assets are measured at fair value and Plan liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the Plan liabilities. Full actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and updated at each balance sheet date. Any surplus or deficit of Plan assets over Plan liabilities is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset (surplus) or liability (deficit).

Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and provision for impairment. Subject to the recognition criteria in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ being met, costs incurred during the period that are directly attributable to the development or improvement of new business application software are capitalised as assets in the course of construction. Assets in the course of construction are transferred to computer software once completed and ready for their intended use. 

Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is three years. No amortisation is charged on assets in the course of construction. Amortisation is included in net operating expenses and the amortisation policies are reviewed on an annual basis. 

Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. 

Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. 

Investments in associates and joint ventures are measured at fair value in line with IFRS 9, as permitted by IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ and are included in investments. 

Investment Property. Investment properties held for long- term rental yields are measured at fair value with changes in fair value included in other income. 

Provisions. Provisions are recognised in the consolidated financial information when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present (legal or constructive) obligation, which has arisen as a result of past events, and for which a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Legal obligations that may arise as a result of proposed new laws are recognised as obligations only when the legislation is virtually certain to be enacted as drafted. 

Equity Instruments. The group’s AT1 notes have been classified as equity instruments. Associated interest is recognised directly in retained earnings when paid.
